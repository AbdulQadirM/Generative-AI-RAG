# LangChain Integration for Text Generation and Retrieval

This repository showcases the integration of LangChain, a powerful framework for text generation and retrieval, into various applications. LangChain enables seamless integration of state-of-the-art language models (LLMs) and facilitates tasks like synthetic data generation and question answering.

## Introduction

LangChain is a cutting-edge framework designed to streamline text generation and retrieval tasks. By leveraging advanced language models and retrieval techniques, it empowers developers to build robust systems for various natural language processing tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: A powerful framework for customizing and deploying language models.
- **LLamaCpp**: A versatile language model utilized for text generation tasks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Integration with state-of-the-art language models.
- **Pinecone**: High-performance vector database for similarity search and retrieval.
- **CSV Loader**: Utility for loading data from CSV files.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: Integration for generating embeddings from Hugging Face models.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all required dependencies installed. You can install them using `pip` or any package manager of your choice.

2. **Set Up Models**: Configure and load the necessary language models and embeddings using the provided functions.

3. **Configure Retrieval**: Set up Pinecone index for efficient document retrieval. Load documents from CSV files and create embeddings for indexing.

4. **Define Prompts**: Customize prompts for language model interactions to suit your specific use case.

5. **Utilize LangChain**: Integrate LangChain components into your applications for tasks like text generation, question answering, and more.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example code snippet demonstrating the usage of LangChain components
from langchain.callbacks.manager import CallbackManager
from langchain.callbacks.streaming_stdout import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import LlamaCpp
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Define functions for loading models, configuring retrieval, defining prompts, etc.

# Sample code snippet demonstrating retrieval chain usage
result = retrivalchain("who is the owner of bert")
print(result)
